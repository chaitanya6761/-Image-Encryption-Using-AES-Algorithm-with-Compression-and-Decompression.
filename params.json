User Registration Form :\r\n  This form allows the user to register by providing details like FirstName, LastName, Email, UserName and Password. All the details of     the user will stored in database.\r\n  \r\n  Screenshot of the form:\r\n  \r\n  ![form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chaitanya6761/Image-Encryption-Using-AES-Algorithm-with-Compression-and-Decompression./master/screen%20shots/ref%20form.JPG)\r\n  \r\n  \r\n## 2. Login  Form :\r\n   This form allows the user to login into the system. The system verifies the credentials  entered by the user by comparing them with        details stored in the database.  \r\n   \r\n  Screenshot of the Login form:\r\n  \r\n  ![form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chaitanya6761/Image-Encryption-Using-AES-Algorithm-with-Compression-and-Decompression./master/screen%20shots/login%20screen.JPG)  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n## 3. Selector  Form :\r\n  This form allows the user to select on of the operations from the window like Encryption, Decryption, Compression and Decompression.       Upon selection the user will be guided to the respective screen.\r\n   \r\n  Screenshot of the Selector form:\r\n  \r\n  ![form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chaitanya6761/Image-Encryption-Using-AES-Algorithm-with-Compression-and-Decompression./master/screen%20shots/selector%20form.JPG)   \r\n  \r\n## 4. Encryption  Form :\r\n This form allows the user to select the image or a text file from the storage and specify a key for the Encryption process.\r\n   \r\n  Screenshot of the Encryption form:\r\n  \r\n  ![form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chaitanya6761/Image-Encryption-Using-AES-Algorithm-with-Compression-and-Decompression./master/screen%20shots/encryption%20form.JPG)\r\n  \r\n##5. Compression Form :\r\n This form allows the user to compress the already encrypted image or text file. Firstly the user needs to select the file from the     storage and then select the one of the compression techniques from the dropdown. The result will be displayed in the status field.\r\n \r\n  Screenshot of the compression form:\r\n  \r\n  ![form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chaitanya6761/Image-Encryption-Using-AES-Algorithm-with-Compression-and-Decompression./master/screen%20shots/compress-cz.JPG)\r\n  \r\n##6. Decryption Form:\r\n This form allows the user to select the already encrypted and compressed file from the stroage. Once the user provides the correct key in respective field then the original file/image will be decrypted.\r\n  \r\n   Screenshot of the Decryption form:\r\n  \r\n  ![form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chaitanya6761/Image-Encryption-Using-AES-Algorithm-with-Compression-and-Decompression./master/screen%20shots/decryption%20form.JPG)\r\n  \r\n##7. Decompression Form:\r\n  In the last user can decompress the already decrypted image/file. The user needs to select the file from the storage and the should   the decompression algorithm from the dropdown and the result will be displayed in the stutus form.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n   Screenshot of the Decompression form:\r\n  \r\n  ![form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chaitanya6761/Image-Encryption-Using-AES-Algorithm-with-Compression-and-Decompression./master/screen%20shots/decryption%20form.JPG)\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n",
